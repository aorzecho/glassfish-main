 * This class is used by tests to deploy WABs. Since a WAB deployment happens asynchronously when a WAB is activated,
 * for a test case to know whether the deployment is successful or not is not as simple as checking if
 * wab.start() returns succesfully or not. This is where this class is helpful. It listens to events raised by the
 * OSGi Web Container as required by the OSGi Web Application spec and depending on the events, returns success or
 * failure when a WAB is deployed. It also uses a timeout mechanism if the deployment does not happen in a
 * specified amount of time.
