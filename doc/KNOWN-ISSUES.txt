Exception [EclipseLink-60] (Eclipse Persistence Services - 2.2.0.v20110202-r8913): org.eclipse.persistence.exceptions.DescriptorException
Exception Description: The method [_persistence_set_userCredential_vh] or [_persistence_get_userCredential_vh] is not defined in the object [org.glassfish.fighterfish.sample.uas.entities.LoginAttempt].
Internal Exception: java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: org.glassfish.fighterfish.sample.uas.entities.LoginAttempt._persistence_get_userCredential_vh()
Mapping: org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.ManyToOneMapping[userCredential]
Descriptor: RelationalDescriptor(org.glassfish.fighterfish.sample.uas.entities.LoginAttempt --> [DatabaseTable(LOGINATTEMPT)])

Exception [EclipseLink-218] (Eclipse Persistence Services - 2.2.0.v20110202-r8913): org.eclipse.persistence.exceptions.DescriptorException
Exception Description: A NullPointerException would have occurred accessing a non-existent weaved _vh_ method [_persistence_get_userCredential_vh].  The class was not weaved properly - for EE deployments, check the module order in the application.xml deployment descriptor and verify that the module containing the persistence unit is ahead of any other module that uses it.

Cause: This happens if a bundle could not be enhanced before it is used. 
There are two conditions under which a bundle fails to get enhanced:
a) If a bundle depends on other bundles which are not available at bundle installation time,
such a bundle can't be enhanced at installation time.

b) If osgi-jpa.jar is not active for whatever reason.

Solution:
If such a bundle uses JPA in Java EE mode, then it should configure its persistence.xml to disable weaving to avoid seeing this exception.
Weaving can be disabled using eclipselink.weaving=false in persistence.xml.
