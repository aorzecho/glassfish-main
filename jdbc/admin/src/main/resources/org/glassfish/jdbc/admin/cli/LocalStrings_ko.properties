#EN create.jdbc.connection.pool.isolationLevel=The transaction-isolation-level on the pooled database connections. This option does not have a default value. If not specified, the pool operates with the default isolation level that the JDBC driver provides. You can set a desired isolation level using one of the standard transaction isolation levels: read-uncommitted, read-committed, repeatable-read, serializable. Applications that change the isolation level on a pooled connection programmatically risk polluting the pool. This could lead to program errors.
