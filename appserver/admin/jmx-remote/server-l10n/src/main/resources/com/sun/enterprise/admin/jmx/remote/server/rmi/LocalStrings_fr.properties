#EN no.port.msg=Port {0} is not available for the internal rmi registry.\

no.port.msg=Le port {0} n\u2019est pas disponible pour le registre RMI interne. Ceci signifie qu\u2019un appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 avec le m\u00eame port sans que l\u2019instance de registre ant\u00e9rieure ait \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9e.
