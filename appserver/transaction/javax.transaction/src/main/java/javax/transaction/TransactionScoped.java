/**
 * Annotation used to indicate a bean is to be scoped to the current active
 *  JTA transaction.
 *
 * The transaction scope is active when the return from a call to
 *  UserTransaction.getStatus or TransactionManager.getStatus is one of the
 *  following states:
 *      Status.STATUS_ACTIVE
 *      Status.STATUS_MARKED_ROLLBACK
 *      Status.STATUS_PREPARED,
 *      Status.STATUS_UNKNOWN,
 *      Status.STATUS_PREPARING,
 *      Status.STATUS_COMMITTING,
 *      Status.STATUS_ROLLING_BACK
 *
 * The transaction context is destroyed after any
 *  Synchronization.beforeCompletion methods are called and
 *  after completion calls have been made on enlisted resources.
 *  Synchronization.afterCompletion calls may occur before the transaction
 *  context is destroyed, however, there is no guarantee.  [this is an open issue]
 *
 * A javax.enterprise.context.ContextNotActiveException will be thrown if an
 *  object with this annotation is used when the transaction context is not
 *  active.
 * The object with this annotation is associated with the JTA transaction where
 *  it is first used and this association is retained through any transaction
 *  suspend or resume calls as well as any beforeCompletion Synchronization
 *  calls until the transaction is completed.
 * The way in which the JTA transaction is begun and completed
 *  (eg BMT, CMT, etc.) is of no consequence.
 * The contextual references used across different JTA transactions are
 *  distinct.
