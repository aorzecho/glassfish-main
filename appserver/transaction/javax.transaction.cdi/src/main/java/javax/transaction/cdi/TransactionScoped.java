/**
 * NOTE THAT THE "cdi" PACKAGE LOCATION OF THIS ANNOTATION IS TEMPORARILY AND WILL LIKELY CHANGE FOR ACTUAL JTA1.2 RELEASE
 * Annotation used to indicate a bean is to be scoped to the current active
 *  JTA transaction.
 *
 * The transaction scope is active when the return from a call to
 *  <code>UserTransaction.getStatus</code> or
 *  <code>TransactionManager.getStatus</code>
 *  is one of the following states:
 *      <li>Status.STATUS_ACTIVE</li>
 *      <li>Status.STATUS_MARKED_ROLLBACK</li>
 *      <li>Status.STATUS_PREPARED</li>
 *      <li>Status.STATUS_UNKNOWN</li>
 *      <li>Status.STATUS_PREPARING</li>
 *      <li>Status.STATUS_COMMITTING</li>
 *      <li>Status.STATUS_ROLLING_BACK</li>
 *
 * The transaction context is destroyed after any
 *  <code>Synchronization.beforeCompletion</code> methods are called and
 *  after completion calls have been made on enlisted resources.
 *  <code>Synchronization.afterCompletion</code> calls may occur before
 *  the transaction context is destroyed, however, there is no guarantee.
 *
 * A <code>javax.enterprise.context.ContextNotActiveException</code>
 *  will be thrown if an object with this annotation is used when the
 *  transaction context is not active.
 * The object with this annotation is associated with the JTA transaction where
 *  it is first used and this association is retained through any transaction
 *  suspend or resume calls as well as any beforeCompletion Synchronization
 *  calls until the transaction is completed.
 * The way in which the JTA transaction is begun and completed
 *  (eg BMT, CMT, etc.) is of no consequence.
 * The contextual references used across different JTA transactions are
 *  distinct.
 *
 *  @since JTA1.2
 *  @deprecated  remove deprecation when packaging is resolved
