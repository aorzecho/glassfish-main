#EN enterprise.deployment.util.no_ejb_in_ejb_jar=Invalid ejb jar [{0}]: it contains zero ejb. \nNote: \n1. A valid ejb jar requires at least one session, entity (1.x/2.x style), or message-driven bean. \n2. EJB3+ entity beans (@Entity) are POJOs and please package them as library jar. \n3. If the jar file contains valid EJBs which are annotated with EJB component level annotations (@Stateless, @Stateful, @MessageDriven, @Singleton), please check server.log to see whether the annotations were processed properly.

#EN enterprise.deployment.util.multiple_ejbs_with_interface=Cannot resolve reference {0} because there are {1} ejbs in the application with interface {2}. \nSome of the possible causes: \n1. The EJB bean class was packaged in an ear lib library (or through any other library mechanism which makes the library visible to all component modules), this makes all the component modules include this bean class indirectly. \n2. The EJB bean class was packaged in a component module which references the EJB, either directly or indirectly through Manifest, WEB-INF/lib. \nThe EJB bean class should only be packaged in the declaring ejb module and not the referencing modules. The referencing modules should only include EJB interfaces.
