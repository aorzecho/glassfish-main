(This file is copied into the jdic workspace after the source-build
project checks it out.)

The JDIC source code is included here because it is a dependency
for building JavaHelp. The JDIC code is not actually built because
the build is platform-dependent. During the JavaHelp build process,
it instead downloads the JDIC binary. See the build.xml file in
javahelp/javahelp_nbproject for details about the location of
the binary.

For full information on building the JDIC source code, see
jdic/src/README.html. The platform-specific build requirements
are here:
