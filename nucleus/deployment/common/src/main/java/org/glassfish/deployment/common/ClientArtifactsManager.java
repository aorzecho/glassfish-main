/**
 * Records artifacts generated during deployment that need
 * to be included inside the generated app client JAR so they are accessible
 * on the runtime classpath.
 * <p>
 * An example: jaxrpc classes from web services deployment
 * <p>
 * Important node:  Artifacts added to this manager are NOT downloaded to
 * the client as separate files.  In contrast, then are added to the
 * generated client JAR file.  That generated JAR, along with other JARs needed
 * by the client, are downloaded.
 * <p>
 * A Deployer that needs to request for files to be downloaded to the client
 * as part of the payload in the http command response should instead use
 * DownloadableArtifactsManager.
 * <p>
 * The various {@code add} methods permit adding content in a variety of ways.
 * Ultimately we need to know two things: where is the physical file on the server
 * the content of which needs to be included in the client JAR, and what is the
 * relative path within the client JAR where the content should reside.  Look
 * carefully at the doc for each {@code add} method when choosing which to use.
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class can be stored in the deployment
 * context's transient app metadata so the various deployers can add to the
 * same collection and so the app client deployer can find it and
 * act on its contents.
 * <p>
 * Because other modules should add their artifacts before the the artifacts
 * have been consumed and placed into the client JAR file, the <code>add</code> methods do not permit
 * further additions once the {@link #artifacts} method has been invoked.
